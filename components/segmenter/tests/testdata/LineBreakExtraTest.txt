# The following 200 monkey tests were generated from
# https://github.com/eggrobin/icu/tree/export-monkeys-15.1-untailor-lb
# (specifically, at 37a8ccbfd9cddc8cff1d9dbb3d35a301043f4ead)
# by running
#   intltest.exe "rbbi/RBBITest/TestMonkey@type=line seed=1729 loop=1000 scalars_only export=meow"
# (note that the loop count is divided by 5 for line breaking).
# They do *not* cover all bugs that were found as part of https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x/pull/4389.
# When actually working on changes to the rules, much longer runs should be used.
